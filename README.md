**Steganography Tool**

This Python project implements a simple steganography tool with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. This tool allows you to hide secret messages within images using the Stegano module.

**Installation**

Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install Pillow stegano tkinter
```

**Usage**

1. **Hiding a Message:**
   - Run the Python script.
   - Click the "Open Image" button to select the carrier image.
   - Enter the secret message you want to hide.
   - Provide the secret key (default: "1234").
   - Click the "Hide Data" button.
   - Click the "Save Image" button to save the image with the hidden message.

2. **Extracting a Message:**
   - Run the Python script.
   - Click the "Open Image" button to select the image with the hidden message.
   - Provide the secret key (default: "1234").
   - Click the "Show Data" button.
   - The hidden message will be displayed in the GUI.

**Technical Details**

- **Tkinter:** Used to create the GUI.
- **Pillow:** Used for image processing.
- **Stegano:** Used for the core steganography operations.
- **OS:** Used for file operations.

**Security Considerations**

- **Key Strength:** A strong, unique secret key is crucial for security. Avoid using weak or easily guessable keys.
- **Image Selection:** The carrier image should be large enough to accommodate the hidden message without significant visual distortion.
- **Steganography Detection:** Be aware of steganography detection techniques and choose appropriate methods to minimize detection.

**Future Improvements**

- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for invalid inputs, file operations, and steganography processes.
- **Advanced Steganography Techniques:** Explore more advanced steganography techniques, such as LSB matching, pixel value differencing, and spread-spectrum techniques.
- **Security Enhancements:** Consider adding features like password protection, encryption, and steganalysis resistance.
- **User Experience:** Improve the user interface with clear instructions, progress bars, and informative messages.

By following these guidelines and considering potential security implications, you can effectively use this tool to securely hide sensitive information within images.
